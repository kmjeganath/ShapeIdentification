                        <p>
                            Rectangles are quadrilateral. For a rectangle, two parallel and opposite sides are equal in length but 4 angles are same. When divided diagonally, the triangles that form in a rectangle are called as the isosceles triangles. A rectangle is always flatter in shape with four distinct points.

                        <h2>It is a Square</h2>
                        <p>
                            A square is a polygon with 4 sides of equal length and 4 right angle corners. Because it has 4 sides of equal length, a square is a regular quadrilateral. The diagonals of a square bisect each other at 90 degrees and are perpendicular. The internal angles of a square add to 360 degrees.
                        </p>

                        <h2>It is a Triangle</h2>
                        <p>
                            Triangles are polygons with the least possible number of sides (three). The three internal angles of a triangle always add to 180 degrees. The longest side of a right angle triangle is called the hypotenuse, it is always found opposite the right angle. Various types of triangles are equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right angle, obtuse and acute triangle.

                        <h2>It is a Pentagon</h2>
                        <p>
                            A pentagon is a 5 sided two dimensional polygon with interior angles that add to 540 degrees. If all sides are equal and all angles are equal, then pentagon is regular, otherwise it is irregular. A regular pentagon has interior angles of 108 degrees and exterior angles is of 72 degrees. An equilateral pentagon is a polygon with five sides of equal length.

                        <h2>It is an Ellipse</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ellipses are like circles which have been squashed or stretched. They have 2 lines of symmetry. The longest and shortest diameters of the ellipse are called the major and minor axes. These axes are also the lines of symmetry.
                        </p>

                        <h2>It is a Circle</h2>
                        <p>
                            Circles have a point in the centre from which each point on the diameter is equidistant. A straight line from the center of a circle to the edge is called the radius. A straight line that passes from one side of a circle to the other through the center is called the diameter. They have infinite lines of symmetry.

                        <h2>It is a Cylinder</h2>
                        <p>
                            A cylinder is a three dimensional object with a circular base and straight parallel sides. The base is the same as the top, and also in-between. It has one curved side. It is not a polyhedron as it has a curved surface.
                        </p>

                        <h2>It is a Crescent</h2>
                        <p>
                            Crescent shapes are made when two circles overlap, or when one circle is removed from another circle . The perimeter of crescents are made from two circular arcs. They have 1 line of symmetry. Our moon forms crescent shapes during its phases.
